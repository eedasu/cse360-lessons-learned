/*******
 * <p> Title: LessonsLearned Class </p>
 *
 * <p> Description: This entity class is one persistent lesson learned.  It holds every piece of
 * information the system keeps about a lesson and provides the Create, Read, Update, and Delete
 * (CRUD) and input validation operations needed by the Contributor User Stories (Phase Two).  It
 * also holds the attributes that the Phase Three epics will need, so that TP3 can add the
 * Curator and AI features without changing the shape of this class or migrating the
 * database again.</p>
 *
 * <p> <b>Attributes.</b>  The attributes fall into five groups.  Each attribute's own Javadoc
 * gives its source and the rationale for including it.</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li> Core information, entered by the Contributor (US-C1): title, description, tags,
 * 		category.  Together with the id, owner, and timestamps these are the "core
 * 		information" of the V1 Contributor story.</li>
 * <li> Lock flags (V1 Contributor; US-R3, US-U1-V, US-D1-V; Epic E6): one per core field plus
 * 		one for the whole lesson.  Contributors can only read them.</li>
 * <li> Experience entries (US-U2, US-R3): loaded on demand, stored in their own table.</li>
 * <li> AI coaching fields (AICoaching.pdf; Epic E1): root cause, recommendation, and a flag
 * 		recording that AI assistance was used.</li>
 * <li> Curator fields (Epics E2 to E5): search terms, who curated the lesson and when, the
 * 		original text before curation, and the statistics summary and its visibility.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> <b>Operations.</b>  The class offers instance and static methods for each CRUD action:
 * create() (US-C1), read() (US-R3), update() (US-U1), delete() (US-D1), plus
 * loadExperienceEntries() (US-R3), updateCuratorFields() and setLock() (Phase Three Curator,
 * used now by tests and demos), and the validation methods validate(), findInvalidField(),
 * and validateField() (US-C1-V, US-U1-V).</p>
 *
 * <p> <b>Design.</b>  Like entityClasses.User, this class contains no SQL.  Every CRUD method
 * delegates to the single shared Database instance in FoundationsMain, and every validation
 * method delegates to inputValidation.LessonRecognizer.  This keeps the Foundations layering
 * intact (SQL only in the database package, validation rules only in the inputValidation
 * package) while giving callers one object that knows how to save, load, and check itself.
 * Authorization (does the requesting user own this lesson?) is deliberately NOT done here; it
 * belongs to the GUI Model that knows who is logged in, which checks it before calling these
 * methods.</p>
 *
 * <p> <b>How the Contributor User Stories are enabled.</b></p>
 * <ul>
 * <li> US-C1 / US-C1-V: the five-argument constructor, findInvalidField() and validate(), then
 * 		create(), which refuses invalid data so nothing invalid is ever saved.</li>
 * <li> US-R1 / US-R4: ownerUserName, used by LessonsLearnedList.loadByOwner() so a
 * 		Contributor's list contains only that Contributor's lessons.</li>
 * <li> US-R3 / US-R3-V: read() returns null for a missing lesson; isFieldLocked() and the lock
 * 		getters tell a screen which fields to show as read-only; loadExperienceEntries().</li>
 * <li> US-U1 / US-U1-V: the setters, isFieldLocked(), validate(), and update().</li>
 * <li> US-U2 / US-U2-V: experience entries are created through ExperienceEntry and loaded here.</li>
 * <li> US-D1 / US-D1-V: isLocked() (a lesson with any locked field cannot be deleted) and
 * 		delete().</li>
 * </ul>
