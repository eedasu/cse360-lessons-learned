/*******
 * <p> Title: DeleteLessonTests Class. </p>
 *
 * <p> Description: Semi-automated tests for US-D1 (a Contributor can delete their lesson after
 * confirming an "Are you sure?" prompt with an explicit "Yes") and US-D1-V (a locked lesson, or
 * a lesson with any locked field, cannot be deleted, and answering anything but "Yes" cancels
 * the deletion).</p>
 *
 * <p> Every test calls ModelLessonDetails.deleteLesson(user, id, confirmed), the method the
 * Lesson Details page's Controller calls after its confirmation dialog closes.  The
 * <code>confirmed</code> argument is the dialog's answer: true for "Yes", false for "No" or
 * closing the dialog.  The dialog itself is shown in the manual test M7 (ManualGuiTests).  See
 * TestSupport for how to read the output.</p>
