/*******
 * <p> Title: TestSupport Class. </p>
 *
 * <p> Description: The shared machinery used by every semi-automated test class in this
 * package.  It connects to the Foundations Database, prints the requirement headers and the
 * result of each test in one fixed format, remembers every lesson the tests create so they can
 * all be removed at the end, and prints the totals.  Keeping this in one place means every test
 * class reports its results the same way, so the output of one class reads like the output of
 * any other.</p>
 *
 * <p> <b>How to read the output.</b>  Every test prints four lines:</p>
 * <pre>
 *   C1-P1  Positive  Create Lesson - Valid Input
 *          Expected: success "Lesson created"; my list holds 1 lesson(s); ...
 *          Actual:   success "Lesson created"; my list holds 1 lesson(s); ...
 *          Result:   PASS
 * </pre>
 * <p> The first line gives the test id (requirement, then P for a positive test or N for a
 * negative test, then a number), the kind of test, and its name.  The Expected line is written
 * by hand in the test method from the requirement.  The Actual line is built from what the code
 * under test really returned and what is really stored in the database afterwards.  A test
 * passes only when the two lines are exactly the same, so the reader can confirm the result by
 * comparing them.  "Positive" means the input is acceptable and the action must succeed;
 * "Negative" means the input or situation is not acceptable and the action must be refused with
 * the specific message shown, leaving the stored data unchanged.</p>
 *
 * <p> The suite ends with "Number of tests passed" and "Number of tests failed", the same footer
 * the Foundations testbed classes (PasswordEvaluationTestingAutomation) print, and throws an
 * AssertionError if any test failed, so a failure cannot be missed.</p>
 *
 * <p> The tests use the real H2 database file.  H2 allows only one connection to that file, so
 * FoundationsMain must not be running while the tests run.  Each test uses its own brand-new
 * username, so lessons left from any earlier run, or created by real users, cannot change the
 * counts a test expects.</p>
