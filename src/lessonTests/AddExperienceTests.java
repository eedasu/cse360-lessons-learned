/*******
 * <p> Title: AddExperienceTests Class. </p>
 *
 * <p> Description: Semi-automated tests for US-U2 (a Contributor can add experience
 * information, a description of what was done and the time/effort in hours, to their lesson),
 * US-U2-V (invalid experience values get a specific message and nothing is saved), and E7, the
 * entity requirement for the optional per-member effort list (each member needs a valid name
 * and hours, the members' hours may not add up to more than the total, and at most 20 members
 * may be listed).</p>
 *
 * <p> Every test calls ModelAddExperience.addExperience, the method the Add Experience page's
 * Controller calls, and then reads the entries back with ExperienceEntry.readForLesson to prove
 * what was stored.  See TestSupport for how to read the output.</p>
